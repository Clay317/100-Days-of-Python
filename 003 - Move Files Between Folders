#The directory must be already created in the destination file.
#You can rename the file with both os and shuntil.

import os

os.rename(r"C:\\Users\\Connor\\Documents\\Ball\\Bat.txt", "C:\\Users\\Connor\\Documents\\Theo\\Stick.txt")


#Shuntil.move works like os.rename in most cases. 
#It will delete the source file, if the files are on different discs. 
#It works better than os.rename, if files are on different directories.
